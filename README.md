# Storefront

## Problem Domain

This is the second part of a 4-Phase build of the storefront application. In this first phase, I setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and behaviors. I organized the file structure and state management so that the application can be expanded upon in a scalable manner. In phase 2, I implemented the the “Add to Cart” feature, which allows the user to select products and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase.

## User Stories

As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products

As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category

As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence

As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart

As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart 

As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart

As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart
