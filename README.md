# Storefront

## Problem Domain

This is the first of a 4-Phase build of the storefront application. In this first phase, I setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and behaviors. I organized the file structure and state management so that the application can be expanded upon in a scalable manner.

## User Stories

As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products

As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category

As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence

## Features

* Create a visually appealing site using Material UI

* Use a Redux Store to manage the state of categories and items in the store

* Display a list of categories from state

* When the user selects (clicks on) a category â€¦
  Identify that category as selected (change of class/display)
  Show a list of products associated with the category

* Begin with creating your application using create-react-app

* Install Material UI as a dependency

* Write an App component that serves as the container for all sub-components of this application
